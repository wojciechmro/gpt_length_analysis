0,"Polymorphism is a concept in programming where different objects can be used interchangeably, even if they have different types or classes. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class.

An example of polymorphism is in OOP inheritance, where a subclass can be treated as an instance of its superclass. For instance, a subclass ""Dog"" can be declared as a type of its superclass ""Animal"". Another example of polymorphism is in method overloading, where multiple methods share the same name but have different parameter types, such as a method ""drive"" that can take in a car or a motorcycle as its parameter. This allows the same method name to be used for different objects, making the code more flexible and easier to maintain.",769,131,155
1,"Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on multiple forms or behave in different ways depending on the context or situation. In programming, it allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they belong to a common class.

One example of polymorphism in object-oriented programming is inheritance. A subclass inherits the properties and methods of its parent class, but it can also add or override these functionalities to create its own behavior.

Another example is method overloading, where a class defines multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. When the method is called with different arguments, the appropriate overloaded method is triggered and executed.

In Java, the concept of polymorphism is heavily used in interfaces where a class can implement multiple interfaces and provide its own implementation for each method declared in those interfaces. This allows for loose coupling and flexible design.",949,147,166
2,"Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows a variable, function, or object to have multiple forms or behaviors. It enables objects of different classes to be treated as if they were objects of the same class. 

One example of polymorphism is method overloading, where a method can be defined with the same name but different arguments. For example, a calculator class might have a method named ""add"" that can take two integers, two decimals, or two strings as arguments. 

Another example is method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. For example, a parent class ""Animal"" might have a ""speak"" method that is overridden in its subclass ""Dog"" to make a barking noise. 

Polymorphism is also used in Java interfaces, where multiple classes can implement the same interface and provide their own implementation for each method. For instance, a ""Shape"" interface can be implemented by a ""Circle"" class and a ""Square"" class, which each provide their own implementation for the ""calculateArea"" method.",1105,176,224
3,"Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as if they were objects of the same class. In other words, it allows objects of different types to be used in the same way.

5,"Polymorphism is a concept in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) that allows objects of different types to be treated as if they are of the same type. In other words, it is the ability of objects to take on different forms or behaviors. 

There are two main types of polymorphism: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. 

Compile-time polymorphism is also known as method overloading. It's when several methods have the same name, but different parameters. The correct method is determined at compile time based on the number and types of arguments passed in. 

Example: 

```
public class MathUtils {
   public int add(int num1, int num2) {
      return num1 + num2;
   }
 
   public int add(int num1, int num2, int num3) {
      return num1 + num2 + num3;
   }
}
```

Runtime polymorphism, also known as method overriding, is when a parent class and a child class have methods with the same name and same parameters, and the child class overrides the parent method. 

Example: 

```
class Animal {
   public void makeSound() {
      System.out.println(""Animal is making a sound"");
   }
}
 
class Cat extends Animal {
   public void makeSound() {
      System.out.println(""Meow"");
   }
}
 
class Dog extends Animal {
   public void makeSound() {
      System.out.println(""Woof"");
   }
}
 
public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Animal myAnimal = new Animal();
      Animal myCat = new Cat();
      Animal myDog = new Dog();
 
      myAnimal.makeSound();
      myCat.makeSound();
      myDog.makeSound();
   }
}
```

In this example, we have an Animal class with a makeSound() method. We then have two subclasses, Cat and Dog, that override the makeSound() method with their own implementation. As a result, when we call the makeSound() method on the Animal, Cat, and Dog objects, they each produce a different sound. This is an example of runtime polymorphism because the method implementation is determined at runtime, based on the type of object we are using.",2004,305,458
6,"Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects or methods to take on multiple forms, depending on the context in which they are used. It allows code to be more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain.

For example, consider a class called ""Shape"", which can be inherited by other classes such as ""Rectangle"", ""Circle"", and ""Triangle"". Each of these sub-classes can have its own method for calculating the area of the shape, but they all share a common interface (i.e. they all have an area() method) which allows them to be treated as instances of the ""Shape"" class. This is an example of ""static polymorphism"" or ""compile-time polymorphism"".

Another example of polymorphism is ""dynamic polymorphism"" or ""run-time polymorphism"", which allows objects of different classes that share a common interface to be used interchangeably. For example, a program that uses a ""Vehicle"" interface can work with objects of classes such as ""Car"", ""Truck"", and ""Motorcycle"", which all implement the ""Vehicle"" interface.

7,"Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming where objects of different classes can be used interchangeably, as they all share a common interface or parent class.

For example, imagine a program that allows users to draw different shapes. Rather than having a separate method for each shape (e.g. drawCircle(), drawSquare(), drawTriangle()), a single drawShape() method could be defined that takes in a Shape object. The Shape class would define the common properties and methods of all shapes, such as a color and a draw() method. Subclasses such as Circle, Square, and Triangle would inherit from the Shape class and implement their own draw() method.

Another example is the use of the ""+"" operator in programming languages such as Java or Python. This operator can be used to add together two integers, concatenate two strings, or even merge two arrays. The functionality of this operator changes depending on the type of the operands, allowing it to be used polymorphically.",1119,180,218

37,"Polymorphism is one of the key concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) and refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms. In simple terms, it means that different objects can be treated as if they were the same type of object. There are two types of polymorphism: static and dynamic. 

Static polymorphism, also known as method overloading, occurs when two or more methods in a class have the same name but different parameters. The correct method to be executed is determined at compile time based on the number, type, and order of the arguments passed to it.

Example: The ""+"" operator in Java can add two integers or concatenate two strings, depending on their type.

Dynamic polymorphism, also known as method overriding, occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class. The correct implementation to be executed is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object.

Example: The draw() method in a Shape class can be overridden in its child classes like Circle, Rectangle, etc, to implement their own unique way of drawing the shape.",1133,191,226
38,"Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were objects of the same class. In simple terms, polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms.

There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism.

Compile-time polymorphism is also known as method overloading. This allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters to coexist in the same class.

Example:

```
public class Calculator {
   public int add(int x, int y) {
      return x + y;
   }
   
   public double add(double x, double y) {
      return x + y;
   }
}
```

Here, two methods with the same name ‘add’ are defined. But they differ in the number and types of their parameters.

Runtime polymorphism is also known as method overriding. With this, a child class can override a method in its parent class to provide its implementation.

Example:

```
public class Animal {
   public void makeSound() {
      System.out.println(""Animal is making a sound"");
   }
}

public class Cat extends Animal {
   public void makeSound() {
      System.out.println(""Meow"");
   }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
   public void makeSound() {
      System.out.println(""Bark"");
   }
}
```

Here, the Animal class has a makeSound() method. The Cat and Dog classes inherit from the Animal class and override the makeSound() method to provide their implementation.",1465,226,314
39,"Polymorphism is a key concept in object-oriented programming that refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as if they are objects of a single parent class. This enables different objects to be used interchangeably, as they share common interfaces and can respond to a single method call in different ways.

For example, suppose we have a parent class called `Animal`, which has many sub-classes such as `Dog`, `Cat`, `Horse`, etc. Each sub-class may have its own unique methods and attributes, but they all share common methods defined in their parent class. This allows us to create a method such as `makeSound()` in the parent `Animal` class, which can be implemented differently in each sub-class. Therefore, when we call the `makeSound()` method on any object of the `Animal` class, we get different sounds depending on the type of animal object.

Another example of polymorphism is the use of the `+` operator in Python. The `+` operator can be used to add two numbers or concatenate two strings, depending on the types of the operands. This is because both integers and strings are types of objects in Python and can be treated as objects of a common parent class such as `object`.",1214,205,254
40,"Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows different types of objects to be used interchangeably, while providing a common interface for all of them. In other words, polymorphism allows you to use a single name that can refer to objects of different classes that share the same behavior.

One example of polymorphism is the “shape” example used in many programming tutorials. In this example, you have different classes that represent shapes, such as square, circle, and triangle. These classes would have their own methods for calculating area, perimeter, and other properties. However, because they all share the same interface (e.g., a method called `calculateArea()`), you can create an array of different shape objects and call the same method on all of them.

Another example of polymorphism is seen in the “animal” example, where you can have a parent class called “Animal” and multiple child classes like “Dog”, “Cat”, and “Bird”. Although each animal has its own unique characteristics (e.g., a dog can bark, a cat can meow), they all share common behaviors like “eating”, “sleeping”, and “moving”. So, by creating a list of animals, it’s possible to call the same methods on all the different types of animals in the list.",1258,203,262
41,"Polymorphism is a principle of object-oriented programming, which allows objects of different classes that share a common interface to be treated as if they were instances of a single class.

When a subclass inherits from a superclass, it can override the superclass's methods with its own implementation, but still use the same method name. This allows the subclass to share the same interface with the superclass, which simplifies the code and allows for greater flexibility.

Another example of polymorphism is the use of interfaces in Java. An interface defines a set of methods that a class must implement, but the implementation of these methods can vary between different classes. This allows multiple classes to have the same interface, but behave differently based on their own specific implementation.

Lastly, the use of function overloading in programming is also an example of polymorphism.

42,"Polymorphism is the ability of an object or method to take on many forms.

Both of these subclasses inherit certain properties and methods from the Animal class (such as a name and a move method), but they also have their own unique properties and methods (such as a bark method for Dog and a purr method for Cat).

Another example would be the use of a single method to handle multiple types of data. For instance, in a graphics program, a draw() method could be used to draw different shapes such as circles, squares, and triangles, by passing different types of objects to the method.

43,"Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming that refers to the ability of objects to take on multiple forms or behaviors within a single class hierarchy.

For instance, an animal class may have a method called ""makeSound,"" and a subclass of that animal like a dog or cat can override that method to produce a bark or meow sound, respectively.

45,"Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where objects of different classes can be treated as objects of the same parent class. In other words, it is the ability of objects belonging to different classes to be treated as if they are from the same class.

Here are some examples of the usage of polymorphism:

1. Method overriding: This is a scenario where a derived class overrides a method from its parent class with its own implementation. When this happens, the derived class can be treated as if it is an instance of the parent class. For example, in Java:

```
class Animal {
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println(""Animal is making a sound"");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  @Override
  public void makeSound() {
    System.out.println(""Dog is barking"");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Animal animal = new Dog(); // Polymorphism in action
    animal.makeSound(); // Output: Dog is barking
  }
}
```

2. Method overloading: This is when multiple methods within the same class have the same name but different parameters. The object decides which method to call based on the types and number of arguments passed to it. For example, in Python:

```
class Calculator:
  def add(self, num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2
    
  def add(self, str1, str2):
    return str1 + str2
    
# Polymorphism in action  
calculator = Calculator()
print(calculator.add(2,3)) # Output: 5
print(calculator.add(""Hello "", ""World"")) # Output: Hello World
```

3. Abstract classes and interfaces: These are special types of classes in OOP that cannot be instantiated. Instead, they are meant to be inherited by other classes, which must provide their own implementation for any abstract methods defined in the parent class or interface. This allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are from the same abstract parent class or interface. For example, in Java:

```
public interface Shape {
  public double getArea();
}

public class Circle implements Shape {
  private double radius;

  public Circle(double radius) {
    this.radius = radius;
  }

  @Override
  public double getArea() {
    return Math.PI * radius * radius;
  }
}

public class Rectangle implements Shape {
  private double width;
  private double height;

  public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
    this.width = width;
    this.height = height;
  }

  @Override
  public double getArea() {
    return width * height;
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Shape shape1 = new Circle(5); // Polymorphism in action
    Shape shape2 = new Rectangle(3, 4); // Polymorphism in action
    
    System.out.println(shape1.getArea()); // Output: 78.53981633974483
    System.out.println(shape2.getArea()); // Output: 12.0
  }
}
```",2820,422,649
46,"Polymorphism is a term used in object-oriented programming to refer to the ability of an object to take on many forms. It basically means that different objects can share the same interface or methods, but have different implementations.

There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time polymorphism (or method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (or method overriding). The former refers to having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, while the latter refers to creating a method in the subclass with the same name and parameters as the one in the superclass.

Here are some examples of polymorphism in use:

1. Method overloading: A class may have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. For example, a calculator class may have a method called ""add"" that takes two integers, and another method called ""add"" that takes two double values.

2. Method overriding: A subclass can define a method with the same name and parameters as the one in the superclass, but with a different implementation. For example, a ""Shape"" class may have a method called ""draw"" that simply prints ""Drawing a shape,"" while a subclass called ""Rectangle"" may override the ""draw"" method to actually draw a rectangle.

3. Interfaces: An interface defines a set of methods that a class implementing it must provide. This allows different classes to share the same interface and be used interchangeably. For example, a ""Flyable"" interface may define a ""fly"" method that can be implemented by classes like ""Bird,"" ""Airplane,"" etc.",1551,248,312
47,"Polymorphism is a fundamental feature of object-oriented programming, which allows different objects to be treated as if they are the same type.

One common example of polymorphism is the use of inheritance, where a subclass can be treated as an instance of its superclass. For example, if we have a class called ""Animal"" and subclasses of ""Cat"", ""Dog"", and ""Bird"", all of these can be treated as ""Animal"" objects when necessary, such as when calling a method that takes an ""Animal"" object as a parameter.

Another example is method overloading, where multiple methods with the same name but different parameters can be defined. For example, we might have a ""calculateArea"" method that can take different shapes as parameters, such as a rectangle, circle, or triangle.

48,"Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they were of the same class. This means that different objects can be used interchangeably, even if their specific implementation details are different.

For instance, a parent class ""Animal"" could have child classes like ""Dog"", ""Cat"", and ""Bird"". All of these classes could have their own unique methods and variables, but they could also share common methods or variables defined in the parent ""Animal"" class. This would allow a program to treat all of these objects as ""Animals"", even though they may have different behaviors, such as making different sounds or having different types of fur or feathers.

Another example of polymorphism in programming is the use of interfaces. Interfaces define a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that inherits from them. This allows different classes to have their own unique implementation of those methods, but also allows them to be treated interchangeably when they share the same interface.

The ""+"" operator can be used to perform addition between two numbers, but it can also be used to concatenate strings. This is possible because the ""+"" operator has been overloaded to work with both numeric and string data types.

Another example is the use of inheritance in object-oriented programming. When a derived class inherits from a base class, it can override or extend the methods of the base class to provide its own implementation.

This flexibility in usage is made possible by providing several methods of the same name with different argument types.

Another example of polymorphism is inheritance. When a class inherits from a parent or base class, it can extend and modify the behavior of the parent class or implement its own behavior. At the same time, the code still refers to an object of the parent class, treating it as if it contains the extension or modification implemented in the child class.

Finally, interfaces are another example where polymorphism is in play. Interfaces contain only abstract methods, which do not have any implementation details, and classes that implement the interface must provide their own implementation.

This allows the subclass to modify or extend the behavior of the parent class. For example, consider a parent class called ""Animal"" and a subclass called ""Cat"".

Here, a base class can have multiple derived classes that inherit the same properties and methods but can have different implementations based on their own specific requirements. The same can be achieved by creating an interface that specifies a common set of methods that can be implemented by different classes in their own way.",1117,180,205
65,"Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms or shapes. In object-oriented programming, it allows different objects to be treated as if they were the same object, and therefore the same methods can be used on them. 

For example, in a program that deals with different types of shapes, a function called ""area()"" can be defined. Using polymorphism, this function can be called on different shapes, such as a square, a circle or a triangle and it will return the corresponding area for each shape. 

Another example of polymorphism is the concept of inheritance in which a child class inherits properties and behaviors from a parent class. The child class may have its own specialized behavior, but still has access to the parent's methods and properties. 

Polymorphism also applies to interfaces, where different objects can implement the same interface but have different implementations of the methods defined in the interface. This allows programmers to write code that can be reused for different objects without needing to know their specific implementation details.",1090,175,205
66,"Polymorphism is a term that describes the ability of objects in object-oriented programming to take on many forms. It allows you to use a single interface to represent different types of objects. Polymorphism is useful for creating reusable and flexible code.

If we create a method in the Parent class that takes an instance of the Parent class as its argument, we can pass either Child1 or Child2 as the argument.

Another example is with the + sign operator in Python. The + sign can be used to add two integers or concatenate two strings. It is polymorphic because the same operator is used for different types of data (integers and strings) with different behaviors.",802,142,167
70,"Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to be used interchangeably, even if they have different implementations of methods. There are two types of polymorphism: static and dynamic.

Static polymorphism is achieved through method overloading, where multiple methods have the same name but different parameters. This allows objects of the same class to have different behavior depending on the arguments passed to the method. For example, the ""+"" operator in Java can be used to add integers, doubles, or Strings, and the method that is executed will depend on the types of the operands.

Dynamic polymorphism is achieved through method overriding, where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows objects of different classes to be used interchangeably as long as they have a common superclass. For example, both a Cat and a Dog can be treated as Animals, and the speak() method of each subclass can be called polymorphically through the Animal superclass.

71,"Polymorphism is a concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which allows objects to take on different forms or behaviors based on the context in which they are used.

This allows multiple related objects to be treated as the same type, but still have different behaviors.

Another example is method overloading, which allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. This allows a class to perform a similar operation on different data types, without the need to write multiple methods with different names.

The use of interfaces in Java is another example of polymorphism. An interface gives a set of methods that are implemented by any class that implements it. This allows multiple classes to utilize the same interface methods, but implement them differently based on their specific needs.",1041,165,191
72,"Polymorphism is a principle of object-oriented programming that allows objects of different types to be treated as if they were the same type. This means that different objects can respond to the same message in different ways, according to their own individual behaviors.

Another example of polymorphism is inheritance, where a subclass inherits methods and attributes from a superclass, but can also override methods or add new ones, changing the behavior of the inherited method. This allows subclasses to share common features but also have their own specific behaviors.",837,130,150
73,"Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that refers to the ability of objects to take on multiple forms. In other words, polymorphism allows different objects to respond to the same message or methods in different ways. Two common examples of polymorphism are:

1. Method Overloading: This occurs when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. For example, in Java, there are two methods called ""println()"" - one for printing strings and another for printing integers. The method gets overloaded to perform different tasks depending on the situation.

2. Inheritance: This is the ability of a child class to inherit and use methods and properties from a parent class. The child class can use the methods of the parent class, modify them or override them to suit its needs. For instance, Animal is a parent class and Dog is a child class, in this case, Dog will inherit the characteristics of Animal class, but Dog can modify it as well.",997,166,196
74,"Polymorphism is a programming concept that allows objects of different classes to be treated as if they are of the same class. It is achieved through inheritance and method overriding. A common example of polymorphism is when a parent class has a method that is overridden by one or more of its child classes.

For example, consider a parent class called ""Animal"" and its child classes ""Cat"" and ""Dog"". The Animal class has a method called ""makeSound()"". The Cat and Dog classes both inherit from the Animal class and override the ""makeSound()"" method to produce their specific sounds:

```
class Animal {
   public void makeSound() {
      System.out.println(""generic animal sound"");
   }
}

class Cat extends Animal {

   }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
   public void makeSound() {
      System.out.println(""bark"");
   }
}
```

Now you can create objects of type Animal, Cat, or Dog, and call their ""makeSound()"" methods. For example:

```
Animal myAnimal = new Animal();
Cat myCat = new Cat();
Dog myDog = new Dog();

myAnimal.makeSound(); // prints ""generic animal sound""
myCat.makeSound(); // prints ""meow""
myDog.makeSound(); // prints ""bark""

75,"Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects to take on different forms or behaviors depending on the context in which they are used. In programming, it allows different objects to be treated as if they were the same type, simplifying the design and making the code more flexible and reusable.

An example of polymorphism in Java is the use of the same method name with different input parameters, leading to different behaviors. For instance, the ""+"" operator can be used to concatenate two strings or add two numbers, depending on the input parameters:

String str1 = ""Hello"";
String str2 = ""World"";
int x = 5;
int y = 7;

System.out.println(str1 + "" "" + str2); //outputs ""Hello World""
System.out.println(x + y); //outputs 12

Another example is inheritance, where a subclass can inherit the behavior of its superclass, but also add specific behaviors of its own. This allows us to use a subclass as if it were a superclass, taking advantage of the polymorphism principle:

public class Animal {
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println(""Animal speaks"");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println(""Dog barks"");
    }
}

Animal myDog = new Dog();
myAnimal.speak(); //outputs ""Animal speaks""
myDog.speak(); //outputs ""Dog barks""",1327,208,291

For example, in object-oriented programming, a parent class may have multiple child classes that inherit its methods. Each child class may implement the methods in its unique way but they all share the same method signature, which allows them to be called the same way.

Another example is the concept of method overloading, where multiple methods with the same name but different parameter types can be defined within a class. This allows for the same method to be used with different data types.

Another example could be a program that calculates the area of shapes. We could create a parent class called Shape with a method called ""calculateArea"". Then, we could create child classes for each type of shape, such as Circle, Square, and Triangle, which each have their own implementation of ""calculateArea"" to fit their specific shape.

In both of these examples, we can see how polymorphism allows for flexibility and versatility in our code, making it easier to write and maintain.",1129,183,224

Compile-time polymorphism refers to the code that is executed at compile time. It is achieved through function overloading or operator overloading. Function overloading allows functions with the same name to have different parameters, while operator overloading allows operators such as +, -, and * to have different meanings based on their parameters.

Runtime polymorphism, on the other hand, refers to the code that is executed at runtime. It is achieved through inheritance and method overriding. Method overriding allows a subclass to redefine an inherited method from its parent class. 

Here are some examples of polymorphism:
- A subclass is polymorphic with its parent class because it inherits all of its parent's methods and can therefore be treated as if it were the parent class.
- An ""Animal"" superclass may have different subclasses such as ""Dog,"" ""Cat,"" and ""Bird."" A method that accepts parameters of type ""Animal"" can accept objects of any of its subclasses, allowing a single method to handle multiple types of objects.
- An overloaded method named ""print"" can accept different parameters such as integers, strings, and floats, and perform different operations based on the parameter types.",1536,238,291

A common example is the use of a superclass Animal that has several subclasses like Dog, Cat, and Horse. They all inherit the common properties and methods of Animal, but can also have unique behaviors specific to their own class.

2. Interface Implementation: Another way polymorphism can be achieved in Java is through interfaces. This allows objects of different classes to implement the same interface and share common methods. For example, a media player program may have different types of audio and video files represented by classes like Mp3, Wav, and Mp4, but they all implement the same interface to play, stop, and pause media files.

3. Method Overloading: This is a form of polymorphism achieved within a single class where different methods have the same name but different parameters or argument types.

Polymorphism in object-oriented programming is achieved through method overriding and method overloading. 

Here are examples of polymorphism:

1. Method Overloading: This is when a class has multiple methods with the same name, but different parameter lists. The compiler determines the correct method to execute based on the parameters of the method call. For example, in Java, the 'print' method is overloaded in the 'System.out' class to allow printing of different types of data.

2. Method Overriding: This is when a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The implementation in the subclass overrides the implementation in the superclass. For example, in Java, the 'toString' method is defined in the 'Object' class, and can be overridden in any subclass to provide a customized string representation of that object.

3. Inheritance: This is when objects of a subclass can be treated as objects of their superclass. A subclass inherits all of the methods and properties of its superclass, and can also add its own unique methods and properties.

Compile-time polymorphism occurs when the correct method to call is determined by the compiler based on the method's name, argument type, and number.

Example: Method overloading in Java. We can define multiple methods with the same name but different argument types and/or number of arguments.

```
public void add(int a, int b) {
    int result = a + b;
    System.out.println(""Result: "" + result);
}

public void add(float a, float b) {
    float result = a + b;
    System.out.println(""Result: "" + result);
}
```

Here, the add() method is overloaded with two different parameter types - int and float.

Runtime polymorphism occurs when the correct method to call is determined at runtime based on the type of object invoking the method.

Example: Method overriding in Java. We can define a method in a subclass with the same signature (name, return type, and parameter types) as a method in its superclass, thereby replacing the original implementation.

```
class Animal {
    public void talk() {
        System.out.println(""Animal is talking..."");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public void talk() {
        System.out.println(""Dog is barking..."");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myPet = new Dog();
        myPet.talk();   // Output: ""Dog is barking...""
    }
}
```

Here, the talk() method is overridden in the Dog subclass, and when we call this method on an instance of Dog as an Animal, it will invoke the Dog-specific implementation.",1750,272,378
99,"Polymorphism means the ability of an object or method to take on many forms. In object-oriented programming, it allows different classes to share a common interface and for objects to be treated as if they are of a common type. 

Here are some examples of its usage: 

1) Inheritance: A superclass can define a method that will be overridden by its subclass. The subclass can implement the method with different functionality, but it can still be called in the same way as its superclass. 

2) Interfaces: An interface is a contract that specifies a set of methods that a class should implement. Different classes can implement the same interface, and they can be used interchangeably as long as they implement the same set of methods. 

3) Method overloading: This allows multiple methods to have the same name but different parameters. When the method is called, the correct one is selected based on the parameters passed in. 

4) Subtype polymorphism: This is when a subclass can be substituted for its superclass. For example, if a method takes an Animal object as a parameter, it can also take a Dog object because Dog is a subclass of Animal.",1148,196,234
